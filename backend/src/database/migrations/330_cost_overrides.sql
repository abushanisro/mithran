-- Migration 330: Persistent, eMithran-style manual overrides for the Cost Summary.
--
-- Before this, "edit a cost line" (material rate/kg, per-process rate/hr, per-
-- process cycle time) was pure React useState in CostSummaryTab — refresh the
-- page, close the tab, or open it on another machine and every manual
-- adjustment silently vanished. That's not viable for a quoting tool: a cost
-- engineer's override on a live quote has to survive a refresh and be visible
-- to a teammate opening the same BOM item.
--
-- Scoped by (bom_item_id, location, field_key) — mirrors migration 329's
-- machine-override location scoping for the same reason: an override entered
-- while viewing India must not silently apply after switching to USA/China,
-- since the cost basis (currency, rates) is entirely different per location.
--
-- field_key values: 'mat_rate' | '<process>::rate' | '<process>::cycleMin'
-- (process = ProcessLineCost.process, e.g. 'Laser Cutting', 'Press Brake').
