    VERSION = "2.2.0"
    CACHE_VERSION = "geo_v41"  # bumped Aug 2026: (18) feature_graph_v2 now carries real "extruded_flange"/"thin_web" feature entries (real OCC face_ids collected during their own detection in _count_holes_with_location, e.g. member[8]/face_idx already used elsewhere in this file -- nothing new derived or guessed) so the frontend's "Detected Geometry" panel can click-to-highlight them in the 3D viewer, the same way holes/bends/cut_profile already could. extruded_flange occurrences are truncated to the counterbore/countersink-corrected count so the highlight list never claims more real occurrences than the reported number.
    CACHE_VERSION_PRIOR = "geo_v40"  # bumped Aug 2026: (17) extruded_flange_count fix -- real debug data (geo_v39) proved the >=2-members/ratio<=1.6 heuristic exactly backwards on a real burled part: the 2 genuine mirror-symmetric M3 burls (3 coaxial layers each, ratio 2.20 -- boss OD notably larger than tap-drill bore, as a real boss should be) were EXCLUDED by the ratio cap, while 3 unrelated plain holes (2 layers, ratio 1.20 -- a coincidental nearby fillet, not a real boss) were wrongly flagged. Now requires >=3 coaxial layers (matching this method's own long-standing "2-3 layers" docstring prediction) with no ratio cap at all -- correctly yields 2 on the verified part instead of 4. bend_count was investigated in the same pass and found genuine (every candidate pairs cleanly into inner+outer radii exactly one sheet thickness apart, zero overlap with burl geometry) -- no change made there. Prior debug logging (item 16, geo_v39) removed now that both investigations concluded.
    # bumped Aug 2026 (v38): (13) new internal_profile_count -- a discrete count of internal cutout wires (slots/scalloped profiles/keyholes, anything that isn't the outer boundary or a plain round hole), returned alongside the existing internal_profiles_mm LENGTH from the same panel-wire walk in _compute_cut_length/_face_breakdown -- counting wires directly needs none of the edge-bridging logic corner-turn detection needs, so it's a simple, reliable addition; (14) new extruded_flange_count ("extrusions") -- _cluster_coaxial_hole_entries already recognized stepped/burled holes (tap-drill bore + a formed collar/boss at a different depth, same axis line) as a byproduct but discarded the cluster size; split into _group_coaxial_hole_clusters (returns the raw clusters) + a thin wrapper preserving prior behavior for its 3 existing callers, so _count_holes_with_location can flag clusters with >1 member and a diameter ratio <=1.6x as a real extruded flange -- a heuristic (disclosed limitation: can overlap with counterbore/countersink classification on the same physical hole via two independent topology passes), coarsely corrected in extract() by subtracting already-classified counterbore/countersink counts (no per-hole spatial matching yet); (15) new thin_web_count ("burr regions") -- true edge-to-edge gap (centroid distance minus both radii, not raw centroid distance) between two holes below 1.5x sheet thickness, the same class of thickness-relative DFM threshold small_hole_count already uses (<2x thickness) -- holes already flagged "small" are excluded from this set at the source so a small hole never double-counts as both a small hole and a thin web
    # bumped Aug 2026 (prior): (1) hole classification now rejects partial-arc cylinders (convex external rounds/fillets misidentified as holes) via a full-circle angular-sweep check, with dedup correctly summing angular coverage across STEP-seam-split fragments instead of taking one fragment's own span; (2) hole-highlight adjacent-rim-face filter now requires both small radial extent AND simple topology, not area alone; (3) feature_graph_v2 now carries a 'cut_profile' feature (every panel's side-wall face_ids, walking EVERY wire not just the outer one, so non-circular cutouts of any shape are covered too) for combined cut-path+holes highlighting; (4) stepped/burled holes (tap-drill + boss/counterbore at different depths, same axis line) now cluster into ONE physical hole (smallest diameter wins) instead of one hole-group entry per diameter layer; (5) cut_length_mm no longer counts fold-transition edges (where a flat panel meets its own bend region, cylinder axis in-plane with the panel normal) as if they were laser-cut edges -- was inflating cut length by up to 28% on a real part; (6) cut_length_mm now also returns cut_length_breakdown (outer_profile_mm / circular_holes_mm / internal_profiles_mm) so the total is independently checkable; (7) new real 2D unfold solver (_compute_flat_pattern_layout) walks the panel/bend adjacency graph to compute the flat pattern's TRUE bounding rectangle -- material_utilization_pct / scrap_area_mm2 -- verified to within 0.2% of a real drawing's flat-pattern dimensions, replacing the earlier parallel-axis-only approximation; (8) _compute_cut_length now also returns longest_continuous_cut_mm -- the single longest unbroken laser path (whole-part outer profile as ONE loop vs. each hole/internal-cutout wire on its own), not the summed total; (9) new _compute_corner_angles returns sharp_corner_count/acute_corner_count by cut-path turn angle, bridging over short CURVED corner-break fillets (which hide their whole turn via G1 tangent continuity at both endpoints) while never bridging short STRAIGHT edges (which can't hide a turn) -- an earlier length-only version wrongly bridged real small notch corners too; (10) new small_hole_count -- holes under 2x sheet thickness in diameter, needing a reduced laser/punch feed rate -- a simple threshold over the existing per-hole diameter list, not a new measurement; (11) new rapid_traverse_sec -- non-cutting head-repositioning time estimated via a nearest-neighbour tour over real hole/slot pierce centroids + one dominant-face reference point for the outer panel; (12) bend_count/bend_radii_mm now come from _collect_dedup_bends (the same clustering _compute_true_flat_pattern_area/_compute_flat_pattern_layout already trusted) instead of the older separate _count_bends_from_full pass, and now also return bend_lengths_mm/bend_angles_deg (real per-bend length/angle, index-aligned with bend_radii_mm) -- previously always null, so press-brake tonnage/machine-selection silently used the flat-pattern's overall bounding dimension as a proxy for bend length instead of each bend's own real length
    # (was silently dropping every hole not aligned with global Z -- e.g. holes on a
    # bent-up wall/wing -- and cut length only ever walked one dominant face)
    # NOTE: this version must also be bumped when classification logic in
